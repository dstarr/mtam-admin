00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.674
Welcome to this module offering
an overview of managed

433100e9-c1f2-4c87-b408-4362c742cffc-1
00:00:05.674 --> 00:00:09.263
applications. Hello, my name is
David Starr, and in this module

433100e9-c1f2-4c87-b408-4362c742cffc-2
00:00:09.263 --> 00:00:12.403
we're going to walk through the
fundamentals of managed

433100e9-c1f2-4c87-b408-4362c742cffc-3
00:00:12.403 --> 00:00:15.992
applications and help Orient you
to the rest of the course. Now

433100e9-c1f2-4c87-b408-4362c742cffc-4
00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:19.469
don't worry, this won't be a
module to tell you what's in all

433100e9-c1f2-4c87-b408-4362c742cffc-5
00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:22.610
the other modules. Let's see
what we're about to cover.

18c5a270-4f1c-492c-bfe2-96681b15b61a-0
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.425
Here's a quick overview of what
you'll find in this module of

18c5a270-4f1c-492c-bfe2-96681b15b61a-1
00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:31.571
the course. We'll take a quick
look at Azure as and see some of

18c5a270-4f1c-492c-bfe2-96681b15b61a-2
00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:35.716
the different flavors of Azure
applications. Next you'll get an

18c5a270-4f1c-492c-bfe2-96681b15b61a-3
00:00:35.716 --> 00:00:39.149
overview of Managed
applications, which is a type of

18c5a270-4f1c-492c-bfe2-96681b15b61a-4
00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.906
Azure application and it's the
one we'll focus on in this

18c5a270-4f1c-492c-bfe2-96681b15b61a-5
00:00:42.906 --> 00:00:43.359
course.

cd9eb23a-c6ba-48ef-86b9-898265add464-0
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.269
Finally, we'll see how managed
applications are integrated into

cd9eb23a-c6ba-48ef-86b9-898265add464-1
00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:49.720
the Azure Marketplace.

dac3d541-2fce-44d0-82ab-529a8b2d3a23-0
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.547
Let's kick off with what an
Azure application is. At their

dac3d541-2fce-44d0-82ab-529a8b2d3a23-1
00:00:54.547 --> 00:00:58.566
core, Azure Apps are simply a
way to package and deploy your

dac3d541-2fce-44d0-82ab-529a8b2d3a23-2
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:02.256
software solution for your
customers. As you'll come to

dac3d541-2fce-44d0-82ab-529a8b2d3a23-3
00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:06.077
understand, throughout this
course, they offer a powerful

dac3d541-2fce-44d0-82ab-529a8b2d3a23-4
00:01:06.077 --> 00:01:09.965
deployment architecture. 1
attribute is that it's a way to

dac3d541-2fce-44d0-82ab-529a8b2d3a23-5
00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:13.786
package existing software
solutions and it's a deployment

dac3d541-2fce-44d0-82ab-529a8b2d3a23-6
00:01:13.786 --> 00:01:17.344
architecture for installing
software to the customers

dac3d541-2fce-44d0-82ab-529a8b2d3a23-7
00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:20.837
tenant, not your own. Azure
applications can contain

dac3d541-2fce-44d0-82ab-529a8b2d3a23-8
00:01:20.837 --> 00:01:21.430
anything.

0bd0efd5-4de1-42c5-af85-f3476c63bb22-0
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.871
In an ARM template can deploy.
If you could deploy a service

0bd0efd5-4de1-42c5-af85-f3476c63bb22-1
00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:29.946
fee in an ARM template, you can
include it in your Azure

0bd0efd5-4de1-42c5-af85-f3476c63bb22-2
00:01:29.946 --> 00:01:34.092
application. Also, it'll contain
the proprietary software

0bd0efd5-4de1-42c5-af85-f3476c63bb22-3
00:01:34.092 --> 00:01:38.525
solution that you've written to
run atop those armed deployed

0bd0efd5-4de1-42c5-af85-f3476c63bb22-4
00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:39.240
resources.

a56c9ab6-c98e-4ce9-bb53-624000346610-0
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.889
For these and other reasons,
publishers often choose Azure

a56c9ab6-c98e-4ce9-bb53-624000346610-1
00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:44.420
Apps to deploy their solution.

b7b6437f-455c-42c9-a03c-fbdd6cf9cbda-0
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.907
Now there are two types of Azure
as one can create solution

b7b6437f-455c-42c9-a03c-fbdd6cf9cbda-1
00:01:49.907 --> 00:01:52.300
templates and managed
applications.

9462822c-725c-4180-ade3-aaf2b1243cf5-0
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.931
The biggest difference between
these two Azure application

9462822c-725c-4180-ade3-aaf2b1243cf5-1
00:01:56.931 --> 00:01:58.580
types is transact ability.

8fe9e8e6-2e7e-4f13-9d6d-4d336dc161c6-0
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.269
Solution templates are not
transactional in the Azure

8fe9e8e6-2e7e-4f13-9d6d-4d336dc161c6-1
00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:06.504
Marketplace. This means they
cannot be sold through

8fe9e8e6-2e7e-4f13-9d6d-4d336dc161c6-2
00:02:06.504 --> 00:02:10.548
Microsoft. This also means that
solution template offers are not

8fe9e8e6-2e7e-4f13-9d6d-4d336dc161c6-3
00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:14.281
eligible for most marketplace
benefits afforded to Transact

8fe9e8e6-2e7e-4f13-9d6d-4d336dc161c6-4
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:15.090
table offers.

61a04342-0c6f-4dfc-8967-18244a99c6ef-0
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.229
Managed applications on the
other hand are transactional.

61a04342-0c6f-4dfc-8967-18244a99c6ef-1
00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:24.158
This means that Microsoft can
sell the solution on your

61a04342-0c6f-4dfc-8967-18244a99c6ef-2
00:02:24.158 --> 00:02:28.648
company's behalf and deploying
managed application offers comes

61a04342-0c6f-4dfc-8967-18244a99c6ef-3
00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:32.718
with many business benefits
which are beyond the scope of

61a04342-0c6f-4dfc-8967-18244a99c6ef-4
00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:37.068
this video now because of their
transact ability. The rest of

61a04342-0c6f-4dfc-8967-18244a99c6ef-5
00:02:37.068 --> 00:02:41.558
this course focuses on managed
applications, so don't expect to

61a04342-0c6f-4dfc-8967-18244a99c6ef-6
00:02:41.558 --> 00:02:45.838
hear too much about solution
template offers that other type

61a04342-0c6f-4dfc-8967-18244a99c6ef-7
00:02:45.838 --> 00:02:46.470
of Azure.

31507660-2b6c-4ab8-b6a1-0e17e80ec0d1-0
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.390
Application.

aa1adee1-df20-4f65-b681-99e3a53e76c8-0
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.610
All right, so let's dig into
managed applications.

01a970a1-4d5b-44aa-8cea-f92170874c7e-0
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.759
Managed apps have some very
unique characteristics. Now, as

01a970a1-4d5b-44aa-8cea-f92170874c7e-1
00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:00.678
we've mentioned, managed apps
are transactional through the

01a970a1-4d5b-44aa-8cea-f92170874c7e-2
00:03:00.678 --> 00:03:04.532
Azure Marketplace and Microsoft
will build the customer on

01a970a1-4d5b-44aa-8cea-f92170874c7e-3
00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:06.099
behalf of the publisher.

92f7c8f7-9337-46b7-87c2-3979864c8dc4-0
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.490
Resources deploy into a special
resource group called a Managed

92f7c8f7-9337-46b7-87c2-3979864c8dc4-1
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.325
Resource Group, or IMRG, in the
customer's tenant. We'll be

92f7c8f7-9337-46b7-87c2-3979864c8dc4-2
00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:19.287
talking a lot about the MRG in
this course, and the fact that

92f7c8f7-9337-46b7-87c2-3979864c8dc4-3
00:03:19.287 --> 00:03:23.250
the MRG exists on the customer's
tenant means the customer is

92f7c8f7-9337-46b7-87c2-3979864c8dc4-4
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.084
paying for running the Azure
resources that are part of the

92f7c8f7-9337-46b7-87c2-3979864c8dc4-5
00:03:27.084 --> 00:03:27.660
solution.

65c71a53-e726-4cf6-8806-833e4d9a504a-0
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.770
Different deployment models
dictate who will maintain the

65c71a53-e726-4cf6-8806-833e4d9a504a-1
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.601
solution. Overtime, we can
specify what access rights the

65c71a53-e726-4cf6-8806-833e4d9a504a-2
00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:40.828
customer and the publisher have
to the MRG. We'll cover this in

65c71a53-e726-4cf6-8806-833e4d9a504a-3
00:03:40.828 --> 00:03:44.791
much greater depth in the next
module of this course on the

65c71a53-e726-4cf6-8806-833e4d9a504a-4
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:49.018
different deployment modes. Now
Speaking of that MRG or managed

65c71a53-e726-4cf6-8806-833e4d9a504a-5
00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:53.047
resource group, let's have a
look at the managed application

65c71a53-e726-4cf6-8806-833e4d9a504a-6
00:03:53.047 --> 00:03:54.169
deployment model.

07ef44da-d026-4543-8163-ba80f2c332fc-0
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.193
Let's walk through a visual on
what's deployed with a managed

07ef44da-d026-4543-8163-ba80f2c332fc-1
00:03:59.193 --> 00:04:03.277
app and how to make the MRG ID
more concrete. When a customer

07ef44da-d026-4543-8163-ba80f2c332fc-2
00:04:03.277 --> 00:04:06.570
purchases the managed
application, two things are

07ef44da-d026-4543-8163-ba80f2c332fc-3
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.193
deployed into the customer's
tenant under the customer

07ef44da-d026-4543-8163-ba80f2c332fc-4
00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:11.050
subscription.

1de253d7-8718-429c-92bf-ccd6059e9cc2-0
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.398
A managed Application instance
is created which essentially

1de253d7-8718-429c-92bf-ccd6059e9cc2-1
00:04:16.398 --> 00:04:20.575
represents the subscription to
the application and I'll find

1de253d7-8718-429c-92bf-ccd6059e9cc2-2
00:04:20.575 --> 00:04:24.752
this on my tenant. If I'm the
customer, I can search for and

1de253d7-8718-429c-92bf-ccd6059e9cc2-3
00:04:24.752 --> 00:04:28.723
find my managed Application
instances that I've purchased

1de253d7-8718-429c-92bf-ccd6059e9cc2-4
00:04:28.723 --> 00:04:32.900
next in a special resource group
called the Managed Resource

1de253d7-8718-429c-92bf-ccd6059e9cc2-5
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.050
Group, the MRG that we've been
talking about.

6fea571f-446b-46b8-9614-87709f5d7646-0
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.250
This contains all of the
resources deployed by the Azure

6fea571f-446b-46b8-9614-87709f5d7646-1
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.060
application and as I said, we'll
visit the MRG over and over

6fea571f-446b-46b8-9614-87709f5d7646-2
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.557
again throughout this course,
what it contains, how the

6fea571f-446b-46b8-9614-87709f5d7646-3
00:04:47.557 --> 00:04:51.617
resources in it are managed, et
cetera. Now you can see that the

6fea571f-446b-46b8-9614-87709f5d7646-4
00:04:51.617 --> 00:04:55.052
MRG has some data storage
services and app service and

6fea571f-446b-46b8-9614-87709f5d7646-5
00:04:55.052 --> 00:04:58.487
even a custom VM in this
particular instance. But as I

6fea571f-446b-46b8-9614-87709f5d7646-6
00:04:58.487 --> 00:05:02.422
said, anything deployable by an
ARM template can be created in

6fea571f-446b-46b8-9614-87709f5d7646-7
00:05:02.422 --> 00:05:06.170
this MRG when deployment of the
managed application occurs.

da15d554-b94c-4f7c-b953-d0388c0f6641-0
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.110
Depending on how you configure
the application to be managed,

da15d554-b94c-4f7c-b953-d0388c0f6641-1
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.880
the publisher may have access to
the MRG and its contents.

74aa7ad5-d610-4655-b8cd-50371ad5ca21-0
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.283
The same is true for customers
whose configuration to the MRG

74aa7ad5-d610-4655-b8cd-50371ad5ca21-1
00:05:20.283 --> 00:05:24.170
and its resources is also
configurable. Thus, customers

74aa7ad5-d610-4655-b8cd-50371ad5ca21-2
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.404
may have different types of
access to the MRG. We'll explore

74aa7ad5-d610-4655-b8cd-50371ad5ca21-3
00:05:28.404 --> 00:05:32.708
this concept of access modes
again in the next module of this

74aa7ad5-d610-4655-b8cd-50371ad5ca21-4
00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:36.664
course, and it's a pretty
important module for you to go

74aa7ad5-d610-4655-b8cd-50371ad5ca21-5
00:05:36.664 --> 00:05:37.219
through.

f96d2608-e44e-4b92-b688-6f7bb7af6be8-0
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.205
So please don't be tempted to
skip through that one now.

f96d2608-e44e-4b92-b688-6f7bb7af6be8-1
00:05:41.205 --> 00:05:44.652
That's the managed application
deployment architecture in a

f96d2608-e44e-4b92-b688-6f7bb7af6be8-2
00:05:44.652 --> 00:05:45.170
nutshell.

9bada453-3144-4c14-a7d9-934754bd3300-0
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.273
Managed apps can also be used
internally to an organization or

9bada453-3144-4c14-a7d9-934754bd3300-1
00:05:50.273 --> 00:05:54.254
through the Azure Marketplace.
Let's take a look at those

9bada453-3144-4c14-a7d9-934754bd3300-2
00:05:54.254 --> 00:05:55.969
differences first of all.

d1ecc335-3a32-49d0-9076-aa73f1c12a72-0
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.665
One can build managed
applications that are meant to

d1ecc335-3a32-49d0-9076-aa73f1c12a72-1
00:06:00.665 --> 00:06:04.468
deploy only within an
organization. Of course, this is

d1ecc335-3a32-49d0-9076-aa73f1c12a72-2
00:06:04.468 --> 00:06:08.133
meant to provide managed apps
that are available for

d1ecc335-3a32-49d0-9076-aa73f1c12a72-3
00:06:08.133 --> 00:06:12.005
installation within an
organization only. And we use an

d1ecc335-3a32-49d0-9076-aa73f1c12a72-4
00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:16.085
Azure service called Service
Catalog to create the managed

d1ecc335-3a32-49d0-9076-aa73f1c12a72-5
00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:20.096
apps available inside the
organization. Now as we'll see,

d1ecc335-3a32-49d0-9076-aa73f1c12a72-6
00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:24.107
we can use the Service Catalog
service for development of

d1ecc335-3a32-49d0-9076-aa73f1c12a72-7
00:06:24.107 --> 00:06:27.150
managed applications in general
during our.

6350b531-2b59-49bc-b596-54c2f3ce4eb8-0
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.581
Development process managed as
are also offered for sale to

6350b531-2b59-49bc-b596-54c2f3ce4eb8-1
00:06:32.581 --> 00:06:34.270
external customers.

131423cd-0dd4-4464-8b9e-b197715a728d-0
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.472
This is done by publishing the
offer inside the Azure

131423cd-0dd4-4464-8b9e-b197715a728d-1
00:06:38.472 --> 00:06:42.545
Marketplace. This has nothing to
do with Service Catalog which is

131423cd-0dd4-4464-8b9e-b197715a728d-2
00:06:42.545 --> 00:06:43.410
internal only.

3544bb1a-54f1-4f0d-998e-376e366e9cb4-0
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.752
This makes the product sellable
and transactional. Now let's

3544bb1a-54f1-4f0d-998e-376e366e9cb4-1
00:06:48.752 --> 00:06:52.343
take a moment to learn just a
little bit about the service

3544bb1a-54f1-4f0d-998e-376e366e9cb4-2
00:06:52.343 --> 00:06:56.299
catalog and how we might use it.
Let's look at a simple model of

3544bb1a-54f1-4f0d-998e-376e366e9cb4-3
00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:59.646
what it means to publish and
deploy an app through the

3544bb1a-54f1-4f0d-998e-376e366e9cb4-4
00:06:59.646 --> 00:07:02.872
service catalog. First, a
deployment package file is

3544bb1a-54f1-4f0d-998e-376e366e9cb4-5
00:07:02.872 --> 00:07:06.706
created and uploaded to a BLOB
storage account. We're going to

3544bb1a-54f1-4f0d-998e-376e366e9cb4-6
00:07:06.706 --> 00:07:10.419
talk a little bit more in a
moment about what goes into this

3544bb1a-54f1-4f0d-998e-376e366e9cb4-7
00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:13.280
deployment package file. It's
just a zip file.

4694926e-6c1e-40c0-9d0d-59c286571511-0
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.762
That contains certain assets
you're going to need that define

4694926e-6c1e-40c0-9d0d-59c286571511-1
00:07:17.762 --> 00:07:21.748
the behavior of your deployment.
Then in the service catalog, we

4694926e-6c1e-40c0-9d0d-59c286571511-2
00:07:21.748 --> 00:07:25.304
create an application definition
and that references that

4694926e-6c1e-40c0-9d0d-59c286571511-3
00:07:25.304 --> 00:07:28.861
deployment package file.
Finally, we can deploy from that

4694926e-6c1e-40c0-9d0d-59c286571511-4
00:07:28.861 --> 00:07:32.111
app definition to create the
actual application. And

4694926e-6c1e-40c0-9d0d-59c286571511-5
00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:34.810
remember, this is all happening
internally.

80a89fb1-7dcc-45a0-a520-abf2e5104fab-0
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.862
Now, the Service Catalog can be
very useful in the development

80a89fb1-7dcc-45a0-a520-abf2e5104fab-1
00:07:39.862 --> 00:07:44.023
of new apps. It gives developers
an opportunity to test out their

80a89fb1-7dcc-45a0-a520-abf2e5104fab-2
00:07:44.023 --> 00:07:47.870
deployments before needing to
test in the Azure Marketplace,

80a89fb1-7dcc-45a0-a520-abf2e5104fab-3
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.653
which would take longer in
between iterations. So there are

80a89fb1-7dcc-45a0-a520-abf2e5104fab-4
00:07:51.653 --> 00:07:55.688
several assets needed to package
and deploy an application. For

80a89fb1-7dcc-45a0-a520-abf2e5104fab-5
00:07:55.688 --> 00:07:59.408
example, you'll need an ARM
template. So the first step is

80a89fb1-7dcc-45a0-a520-abf2e5104fab-6
00:07:59.408 --> 00:08:03.570
to create these assets that will
deploy your solution, and that's

80a89fb1-7dcc-45a0-a520-abf2e5104fab-7
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.840
what goes in to that packaged
file.

f382ba0a-edbc-4727-9991-7cc112af47f8-0
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.511
That deployment package file
that we were talking about just

f382ba0a-edbc-4727-9991-7cc112af47f8-1
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:09.010
a moment ago.

29e9e73f-9ede-4601-9175-e8a6227954a0-0
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:14.122
Next, the deployment assets are
loaded into the service catalog.

29e9e73f-9ede-4601-9175-e8a6227954a0-1
00:08:14.122 --> 00:08:18.008
This makes the solution
available for deployment. Deploy

29e9e73f-9ede-4601-9175-e8a6227954a0-2
00:08:18.008 --> 00:08:22.508
the a as an internal application
to check the deployment process.

29e9e73f-9ede-4601-9175-e8a6227954a0-3
00:08:22.508 --> 00:08:25.918
This gives developers an
opportunity to try their

29e9e73f-9ede-4601-9175-e8a6227954a0-4
00:08:25.918 --> 00:08:29.600
deployment package before
integrating into our formal

29e9e73f-9ede-4601-9175-e8a6227954a0-5
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.896
offer in the Azure Marketplace.
The basic idea here is that we

29e9e73f-9ede-4601-9175-e8a6227954a0-6
00:08:33.896 --> 00:08:37.918
can use the service catalog
during our process of building

29e9e73f-9ede-4601-9175-e8a6227954a0-7
00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:39.760
up our managed application.

1d903b93-1c43-48da-9678-bfbfeda61d48-0
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.750
Assets that we ultimately will
publish into the marketplace.

cf5c0e99-540b-4575-b7fd-7769ef39f798-0
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.205
We discussed how the Service
Catalog in Azure can be helpful

cf5c0e99-540b-4575-b7fd-7769ef39f798-1
00:08:49.205 --> 00:08:52.620
to our development process, and
it's important to remember that

cf5c0e99-540b-4575-b7fd-7769ef39f798-2
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.982
it's a great tool, but does not
make our application available

cf5c0e99-540b-4575-b7fd-7769ef39f798-3
00:08:55.982 --> 00:08:58.009
as an offer in the Azure
Marketplace.

40fcce06-e4b4-4cda-9558-6a5ea7939963-0
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.604
Now we spent a little time here
on service catalog because it

40fcce06-e4b4-4cda-9558-6a5ea7939963-1
00:09:02.604 --> 00:09:06.592
will be used in labs and in some
later demos, so it's useful to

40fcce06-e4b4-4cda-9558-6a5ea7939963-2
00:09:06.592 --> 00:09:07.590
know what it is.

e9cb68eb-5e5a-4128-bb24-659bf3547402-0
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.171
Now that we've seen a bit about
managed apps and the fact that

e9cb68eb-5e5a-4128-bb24-659bf3547402-1
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:17.020
we can use them in the context
of a service catalog in Azure,

e9cb68eb-5e5a-4128-bb24-659bf3547402-2
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.931
let's focus on how managed apps
work in the Azure Marketplace.

e9cb68eb-5e5a-4128-bb24-659bf3547402-3
00:09:20.931 --> 00:09:24.656
At the time of this recording,
There are four transactional

e9cb68eb-5e5a-4128-bb24-659bf3547402-4
00:09:24.656 --> 00:09:28.444
offer types one may choose from
when creating offers for the

e9cb68eb-5e5a-4128-bb24-659bf3547402-5
00:09:28.444 --> 00:09:31.920
Azure Marketplace, and these
differ based on deployment

e9cb68eb-5e5a-4128-bb24-659bf3547402-6
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.790
architectures.

22166c33-0565-47ca-8dd6-24e3383b965b-0
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.648
Offers that integrate with the
Publisher Software as a service

22166c33-0565-47ca-8dd6-24e3383b965b-1
00:09:37.648 --> 00:09:39.690
product architecture our offers.

90d2b76b-dbad-4904-a2bf-42d115620819-0
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.898
Container offers allow packaging
your solution into containers

90d2b76b-dbad-4904-a2bf-42d115620819-1
00:09:44.898 --> 00:09:49.189
and deploying to the customers.
Azure Kubernetes Service Virtual

90d2b76b-dbad-4904-a2bf-42d115620819-2
00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:53.347
Machine Offers allow packaging
solutions onto virtual machines

90d2b76b-dbad-4904-a2bf-42d115620819-3
00:09:53.347 --> 00:09:56.780
and deploying those VMS into the
customer's tenant.

d506601b-4152-4136-9293-bbe93050ad05-0
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.100
Managed applications of course,
which are the focus of this

d506601b-4152-4136-9293-bbe93050ad05-1
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.528
course. Just know that there are
different deployment models

d506601b-4152-4136-9293-bbe93050ad05-2
00:10:05.528 --> 00:10:08.674
based on different solution
architecture needs. But all

d506601b-4152-4136-9293-bbe93050ad05-3
00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:11.989
managed A offers deploy into the
customer's tenant. That's

d506601b-4152-4136-9293-bbe93050ad05-4
00:10:11.989 --> 00:10:13.450
something to keep in mind.

6fb4fe68-2025-45bb-aa31-9c47b58fad95-0
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.184
And you've already seen that
it's deployed into the

6fb4fe68-2025-45bb-aa31-9c47b58fad95-1
00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:22.159
customer's tenant. So now let's
see how that works with the

6fb4fe68-2025-45bb-aa31-9c47b58fad95-2
00:10:22.159 --> 00:10:26.134
Azure marketplace. Here's a
public marketplace offer that's

6fb4fe68-2025-45bb-aa31-9c47b58fad95-3
00:10:26.134 --> 00:10:29.976
been defined and has three
associated plans, Silver, Gold

6fb4fe68-2025-45bb-aa31-9c47b58fad95-4
00:10:29.976 --> 00:10:33.686
and Platinum, say just for
example purposes. And when a

6fb4fe68-2025-45bb-aa31-9c47b58fad95-5
00:10:33.686 --> 00:10:37.330
customer subscribes to the Gold
plan, for example, the

6fb4fe68-2025-45bb-aa31-9c47b58fad95-6
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.702
deployment occurs. The Gold plan
has a deployment package for the

6fb4fe68-2025-45bb-aa31-9c47b58fad95-7
00:10:41.702 --> 00:10:45.810
managed app and it deploys the
required elements or services.

53c859a6-4146-4f7b-9be0-f6f21ef16229-0
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:51.098
Into the customer's tenant into
that MRG. Note that each plan

53c859a6-4146-4f7b-9be0-f6f21ef16229-1
00:10:51.098 --> 00:10:55.961
has its own definition of the
managed A and can therefore

53c859a6-4146-4f7b-9be0-f6f21ef16229-2
00:10:55.961 --> 00:11:00.069
deploy different resources into
an MRG per plan.

095dca3f-b70a-4e92-8eeb-7e0e2a712a18-0
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.348
So my silver plan might include
a particular database, whereas

095dca3f-b70a-4e92-8eeb-7e0e2a712a18-1
00:11:05.348 --> 00:11:09.210
my gold plan may include a
different one or none at all.

b4721591-93f7-40d6-8a09-192e9a055555-0
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.638
Each plan has an associated
deployment package that's held

b4721591-93f7-40d6-8a09-192e9a055555-1
00:11:13.638 --> 00:11:16.130
in that zip file. We've talked
about that.

af230359-f4b4-4567-85b0-f9a8b2db6ad0-0
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:21.902
Just a little bit and note that
they associate 2 plans O these

af230359-f4b4-4567-85b0-f9a8b2db6ad0-1
00:11:21.902 --> 00:11:26.494
deployment packages contain
artifacts like the ARM template

af230359-f4b4-4567-85b0-f9a8b2db6ad0-2
00:11:26.494 --> 00:11:31.087
that does the deployment and the
file that defines the user

af230359-f4b4-4567-85b0-f9a8b2db6ad0-3
00:11:31.087 --> 00:11:35.450
interface a customer sees when
subscribing to the offer.

3fe0a19c-9c3f-4438-abaf-b40c1a0afc2a-0
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.892
There are some considerations
for how to set U your offer such

3fe0a19c-9c3f-4438-abaf-b40c1a0afc2a-1
00:11:39.892 --> 00:11:42.610
that the customer is billed for
the solution.

0e5ae382-fa35-41da-9195-648c59c72369-0
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.631
At the time of this recording,
only monthly billing is

0e5ae382-fa35-41da-9195-648c59c72369-1
00:11:46.631 --> 00:11:49.782
supported for managed
applications. This may change

0e5ae382-fa35-41da-9195-648c59c72369-2
00:11:49.782 --> 00:11:52.690
with time as more billing
options are explored.

9b122e7e-8e32-4bfd-bd0d-3bdb9d41c6a9-0
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.346
For example, annual billing.
That's a possible billing model,

9b122e7e-8e32-4bfd-bd0d-3bdb9d41c6a9-1
00:11:58.346 --> 00:12:02.488
it's just not supported today.
For managed applications today,

9b122e7e-8e32-4bfd-bd0d-3bdb9d41c6a9-2
00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:06.236
a publisher may for example set
the monthly price of the

9b122e7e-8e32-4bfd-bd0d-3bdb9d41c6a9-3
00:12:06.236 --> 00:12:10.509
solution. It's even possible to
set the monthly charge as $0.00.

cd95db2e-1b87-4906-aced-98f2b91ea996-0
00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.150
It also supports metered
billing.

bf396819-3e26-41a2-8457-7de161bacddf-0
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.344
In addition to flat rate
pricing, metered billing is

bf396819-3e26-41a2-8457-7de161bacddf-1
00:12:18.344 --> 00:12:22.089
available on managed apps and
we'll go much deeper into

bf396819-3e26-41a2-8457-7de161bacddf-2
00:12:22.089 --> 00:12:26.035
metered billing later in the
course. But for now, think of

bf396819-3e26-41a2-8457-7de161bacddf-3
00:12:26.035 --> 00:12:30.115
this as billing per transaction.
The managed application can

bf396819-3e26-41a2-8457-7de161bacddf-4
00:12:30.115 --> 00:12:33.860
charge for specific transactions
that take place in the

bf396819-3e26-41a2-8457-7de161bacddf-5
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.074
application. For example, take
the case of a document scanning

bf396819-3e26-41a2-8457-7de161bacddf-6
00:12:38.074 --> 00:12:42.421
service, the solution may charge
some amount per month as a flat

bf396819-3e26-41a2-8457-7de161bacddf-7
00:12:42.421 --> 00:12:45.029
fee and an additional amount per
scan.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.741
One penny, for example. With
these billing capabilities,

d86f27e8-2746-48b7-a7fb-f609f1250959-1
00:12:48.741 --> 00:12:52.178
publishers can construct
different ways to price their

d86f27e8-2746-48b7-a7fb-f609f1250959-2
00:12:52.178 --> 00:12:53.990
solutions in the marketplace.

31be3fc2-a093-4413-baef-90b0dbf9b123-0
00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.495
All right, let's have a quick
look at what we talked about in

31be3fc2-a093-4413-baef-90b0dbf9b123-1
00:12:58.495 --> 00:13:02.248
this module. We got a high level
overview of Azure applications

31be3fc2-a093-4413-baef-90b0dbf9b123-2
00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:06.060
and saw that there are two types
of them, Solution templates and

31be3fc2-a093-4413-baef-90b0dbf9b123-3
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.578
managed apps. Managed apps being
the transactional type and

31be3fc2-a093-4413-baef-90b0dbf9b123-4
00:13:09.578 --> 00:13:11.690
therefore the focus of this
course.

ab9bbbb9-2370-4daf-ab92-e9261a1c33ec-0
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.385
You got an overview of managed
applications to include the

ab9bbbb9-2370-4daf-ab92-e9261a1c33ec-1
00:13:16.385 --> 00:13:20.090
basic deployment architecture
and we saw that we can use

ab9bbbb9-2370-4daf-ab92-e9261a1c33ec-2
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.405
managed apps with the Azure
Marketplace to deliver

00:13:23.405 --> 00:13:27.565
transactional solutions to our
customers. This means publishers

ab9bbbb9-2370-4daf-ab92-e9261a1c33ec-4
00:13:27.565 --> 00:13:31.335
can package and sell their
software solutions through the
